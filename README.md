*Sleep is an essential bodily function to maintain optimal physical and mental health. A good night's rest allows the body to reset, rest, and has been proven to have extreme benefits, however there are several factors that can affect how efficient and how long a person sleeps per night. As technology has advanced, it has become easier to track not only time sleeping, but sleep quality on a regular basis using devices such as health trackers and smart watches.
 In our study, we attempt to find correlations between several external factors that may affect sleep duration and sleep efficiency in adults.*

 *  Data Set used for this analysis is downloaded from Kaggle. It was provided was collected as part of a study conducted in the UK by a research team from The University of Oxfordshire

 *  Overview of Population:
    -  Overall population count - 
    -   % Male - 50
    -   % Female - 50
    -   Age Range - 9 to 69


*   Deep and Light Sleep v/s Sleep Efficiency
    -   From the high degree of correlation between sleep efficiency and deep sleep percentage, it is safe to assume that   sleep efficiency score is derived from the deep sleep percentage


*   Factors affecting Sleep
    -   Age - There was no coorelation found between sleep efficiency and age. The r-value is 0.12 which points to almost non-existent coorelation.
    -   Gender
        - 41-50 age group has lowest sleep duration but highest efficiency for females
        - After age 50, women have higher sleep duration but lower sleep efficiency
    -   Alocohol Consumption
    -   Smoking


*   Possible Bias
